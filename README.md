# quadraticRootFinder
Windows form written in C#, personal project, quadratic root finder that calculates only the real solutions of a quadratic function

I created this as a personal project to help students find the real solutions to quadratic functions.  The discriminant must be greater than 0 to return any solutions.
Program and form logic is in Form1.cs.
